# Vendored: the two live-TV playback engines

Vendored (not fetched from a CDN at runtime) so `/live` works without
depending on a third-party script host.

- `hls.min.js` — plays HLS (`.m3u8`) channels in browsers with no native
  support. Source: [`video-dev/hls.js`](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js)
  `1.5.17`, npm `dist/hls.min.js`, Apache-2.0.
- `shaka-player.compiled.js` — plays the DRM (Widevine) channels.
  Source: [`shaka-project/shaka-player`](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player)
  `4.16.3`, npm `dist/shaka-player.compiled.js`, Apache-2.0.

To update: `npm pack hls.js@<version>` (or `shaka-player@<version>`),
extract the file named above from `package/dist/`, and bump the version
here. Nothing else references the version.

These two sit in `/shared/vendor/` rather than beside `live.html` because
a `live/` directory would collide with the extensionless `/live` URL that
GitHub Pages serves `live.html` from — which the bottom navigation, the
service worker's precache list and the popup blocker's scope check all
rely on.

They are deliberately **not** in the service worker's `SHELL_URLS`:
together they are over a megabyte, and most visitors never open `/live`.
The `/shared/` rule in `sw.js` caches them stale-while-revalidate on
first use instead, which is the same treatment the tools' own vendored
engines get.

## Why not a CDN with an integrity hash

They were loaded from cdnjs, with no `integrity` attribute, in the
`<head>` of `live.html`. That put a third party in a position to run
script on this origin — the same origin whose `localStorage` the
authenticator keeps its TOTP secrets in, unencrypted, by design.

Adding Subresource Integrity would have closed that, but vendoring closes
it and three other things at once: the page no longer blocks on a
third-party connection before first paint, it keeps working when cdnjs is
blocked (which it is, on plenty of networks), and it matches what every
other tool in this repo already does with its engine. Every dependency
here is now a file in the repo.
