/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Hand the embed a window that isn't one, and take away the two ways of
   opening one that never ask window.open at all.

   Registered at runtime against the origins of whatever sources are
   configured — never a hardcoded list, and never a site the user has not
   granted. It runs in the MAIN world of those frames, because the things
   it replaces are the page's own.

   Why a decoy rather than a refusal: a source that will not play under a
   sandbox is detecting that window.open *failed*. Returning null, throwing,
   or being sandboxed all look identical to it. So this returns something
   truthy and well-behaved, and simply never opens anything. Nothing is
   created, so there is no tab to close and no flash to see.

   The shape below is what popup scripts actually touch. Most do:

       var w = window.open(url, "_blank");
       if (!w || w.closed) { ...fall back to redirecting your tab... }
       w.focus();

   so `closed` staying false matters as much as the object existing — a
   decoy that reports itself closed just pushes them to the tab-under.

  /* ── Targets that open a tab without asking ──────────────────────────
     window.open is only half of it, and on these embeds it is the smaller
     half. The overlay stretched across the video is an <a target="_blank">,
     and a real click on it is a real click: Chrome opens the tab natively,
     there is no open() call to hand a decoy to, and the only thing left is
     to close the tab afterwards — which is the flash.

     _top and _parent are the same trick pointed the other way. They send
     the tab the player is in to the ad, and because a click drove it the
     navigation carries no `client_redirect`, so the worker's tab-under
     rule does not fire on it either.

     None of these is a navigation this frame is ever entitled to make: it
     is a video embed, and a video embed has no business opening tabs or
     replacing the one it is in. So the default is cancelled. It is
     cancelled in the capture phase and without stopping propagation, so
     the embed's own click handlers still run — a click on the overlay
     still reaches the player underneath it, and only the navigation is
     lost. ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */
