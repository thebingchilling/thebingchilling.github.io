/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Close every popup the player opens.

   The player streams from third-party embeds, and those embeds open tabs:
   window.open() on the first click anywhere in the video, target="_blank"
   on an invisible overlay stretched across the whole frame, a blank tab
   written into after the fact. Chrome's own blocker misses nearly all of
   it, because every one of them is technically a click the user made.

   What separates those from a tab the user actually wanted is the frame
   that asked for it. The embed sits in an <iframe>, so everything it opens
   comes from a frame below the top one; a tab the page itself opens — a
   middle-clicked bottom-nav link today, a first-party window.open if one
   is ever added — comes from frame 0. So the frame is the test, and two of
   the three rules below are built around keeping it.

   The third cannot see frames, and leans instead on the narrower fact that
   neither player page currently opens a blank tab. That one is marked, and
   is the one to revisit if that changes.

   Scope is enforced by the permission, not just by the path list below:
   tabs.get() fills in a tab's URL only for hosts the extension can access,
   and the only host in the manifest is thebingchilling.github.io. A tab on
   any other site comes back with no URL at all and fails isPlayerUrl()
   before its path is ever considered. /tools/ fails on the path.

/* ── How long the popup is on screen ───────────────────────────────────
   Everything between Chrome creating the popup and this closing it is
   time the popup is visible, so the close path is built to have nothing
   in front of it.

   It used to await chrome.tabs.get on every popup, purely to ask whether
   the opener was a player tab — a message to the browser process and back
   before the close could even be requested. And because a service worker
   is evicted after ~30s idle, the popup was frequently what *woke* it, so
   a cold start was on the clock too.

   So the answer is kept here instead, in memory, in a worker that a port
   from content/keepalive.js keeps resident while a player tab is open.
   The hot path is now a Map lookup and a remove, with no await before it.

   The slow path stays for the case the fast one cannot cover: a worker
   that started without the port (an update, a crash) and has not yet
   heard from the tab. It is the old behaviour, used as a fallback. */

   way around a popup blocker, and the only trace it leaves is a new tab
   whose opener is the player.

   ⚠ tabs.onCreated does not report the frame, so this rule cannot use the
   test the other two rest on. It narrows itself to blank targets instead,
   which is safe only while neither player page opens one. If one ever
   does, this is the rule that needs the frame test back — most cheaply by

   and so no match here at all. */

/* ── Tab-unders ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The other half of the trick. Rather than open the ad in front of you,
   the embed sends the player's own tab to the ad and moves the video into
   a popup behind it, so that what you close is the player and what you are
   left looking at is the ad.

   Catching it means knowing where the tab just was, and by the time the
   navigation commits the tab's URL is the ad's. So every player page a tab
   lands on is recorded first, in session storage rather than a variable:
   this worker is torn down after ~30s idle, and an in-memory note of which
   tabs hold the player would be gone by the time a two-hour film ended.

   `client_redirect` is the qualifier Chrome attaches to a navigation a
   script started. A link the user actually clicked commits without it, as
   does the address bar — so neither can be undone by this. */

   Stubbing window.open inside the sources

   Closing a popup is always late: Chrome makes the tab, it takes focus and
   paints, and only then does it go away. The way to have nothing to close
   is for window.open never to open anything — which means running inside
   the embed's frame, which means permission for the embed's origin.

   Those origins are not known here and must not be. They are read from the
   configured sources on the player page and arrive over the port, so a
   renewed source is picked up by reloading the player rather than by
   shipping a new extension. Nothing about them is written to the manifest.

   Chrome will not grant a host at runtime without a user gesture, so new
   origins wait behind one click on the toolbar icon. The badge says when
   there is something to click for. Origins that drop out of the list need
   no gesture to drop out of the grant, and are revoked on sight.
