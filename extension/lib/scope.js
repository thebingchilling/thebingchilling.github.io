   What counts as "the player", and nothing else.

   The site is one origin with two very different halves. The player — the
   root page, which builds <iframe> embeds out of user-configured streaming
   sources, and live.html, which plays HLS — is where popups come from.
   /tools/ is first-party code that opens nothing and needs nothing blocked;
   blocking there would mean a tools page that legitimately wants to open a
   tab silently fails, with no UI anywhere to explain why.

   So the scope is a path allow-list rather than a host one. If a player
   page is ever added, it goes here.

   by falling back to the .html file, and the site takes it up: its own
   service worker precaches "/live" alongside "/live.html", and the bottom
   navigation links to the bare "/live". A tab sitting on that URL is the
   player just as much as one on "/live.html". */
